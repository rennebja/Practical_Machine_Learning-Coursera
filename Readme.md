## Readme

This repository is for submission of the final project in the Practical Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera provided by Johns Hopkins University. The purpose of the project is to create a machine learning model that can be used to classify the manner in which bicep curls were performed based upon on-body sensor data.

Practical_Machine_Learning_final.Rmd is an R Markdown file containing all code needed to reproduce the reported results, and its html counterpart is an R Notebook containing all output for easy review without the need to run the code itself. All data needed to reproduce the results can be found in the data directory.

Data for this project was provided by the Groupware Human Activity Recognition Project (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)
